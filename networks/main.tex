\begin{defn}[Degree]
    The degree $d_i$ of a node $i$ is given by its number of neighbors, i.e. $|\clN(i)|$.
  \end{defn}
\begin{defn}[Degree distribution]
    In a graph $\clG = (\clV, \clE)$, recall that $d_i$ counts the number of incident edges in $\clE$ to $i$. Define $f_d$ to be
    the fraction of vertices $i\in \clV$ with degree $d_i=d$. The collection $\set{f_d, d\geq 0}$ is called the degree distribution of $\clG$.
  \end{defn}
  
    Many real world networks have a degree distribution fitting well power law distributions: 
    \[
      f_{d_i}(d) = \P(d_i = d) = \frac{c}{d^\gamma}, \quad c\in\Rset, \gamma > 0.
    \]

  Those heavy-tail distributions describe few vertices with very high degrees.
  
  \begin{defn}[distance]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The Length  of a path $e_1,\dots, e_k$ is the number of edges entering the path (here $k$).
    \item If two nodes $i,j$ are connected in $G$, then the distance $\ell_{ij}$ is the length of the shortest path between $i$ and $j$. If the two nodes are not connected then $\ell_{ij} = \infty$.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{defn}
  
  \begin{defn}[mean distance]
    Mean distance in $\clG = (\clV,\clE)$ is defined by
    \[
      \bar{\ell} = \frac{1}{n(n-1)}\sum_{(i,j)\in\clV^2} \ell_{ij} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i<j} \ell_{ij}.
    \]
  \end{defn}

  \begin{defn}[diameter]
    The diameter of $\clG$ is the greatest distance between two nodes:
    \[
      \mathrm{diameter(\clG)} = \max_{(i,j)\in\clV\times\clV} \left(\ell_{ij}\right)
    \]
  \end{defn}
  \begin{defn}[Farness, Closeness]
    Farness is the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. Closeness is defined as its reciprocal:
    \[C(x)={\frac  {1}{\sum _{y}d(y,x)}}.\]
    $\rightsquigarrow$ \textit{The more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.}
  \end{defn}
  
  \begin{defn}[Betweenness]
    For every pairs of vertices, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices such that the number of edges that the path passes through is minimized.
    The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex: 
    \[
        g(i)=\sum _{{j\neq i\neq k}}{\frac  {\sigma _{{jk}}(i)}{\sigma _{{jk}}}}    
    \]
    where $\sigma _{jk}$ is the total number of shortest paths from node $j$ to node $k$ and $\sigma _{jk}(i)$ the number of those paths that pass through $i$.

  \end{defn}
